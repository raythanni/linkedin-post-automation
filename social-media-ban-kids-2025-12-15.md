your country will ban social media for kids within 2 years.

here's why i'm not mad about it.

australia just went first. under-16s are now locked out of tiktok, instagram, all of it.

as a parent, i've watched the algorithm turn my kid's attention span into confetti.

so part of me wants to applaud.

but here's what no politician is saying out loud:

this won't work. not fully.

not because the idea is bad. but because kids are smarter than legislation.

in the 90s, my parents blocked MTV. i watched it at my friend's house.

in the 2000s, schools blocked gaming sites. we used proxy servers before we could drive.

in 2025, australia blocks tiktok. kids will use VPNs, fake birthdays, and their older sibling's account.

prohibition has never defeated curiosity.

so why am i still cautiously supportive?

because this isn't really about stopping kids from accessing social media.

it's about something bigger.

here's what actually happens next:

1. **other countries follow within 18 months**
the UK, parts of the EU, and certain US states are already drafting similar bills. australia just gave them political cover.

2. **platforms are forced to redesign**
age verification becomes a real product problem. expect biometric checks, AI age detection, and parental dashboards as standard.

3. **a "kids internet" emerges**
just like kids TV channels, we'll see walled-garden platforms for under-16s. youtube kids was the prototype. the next wave will be far more sophisticated.

4. **the workarounds create a black market**
VPN usage among teens will skyrocket. ironically, the kids who bypass the ban will be more tech-savvy than ever.

5. **parents still do the hard work**
no legislation replaces the dinner table conversation. the ban buys time. it doesn't buy parenting.

the real question isn't whether this works perfectly.

it's whether imperfect action is better than perfect inaction.

i think it is.

what's your take - will your country be next?
