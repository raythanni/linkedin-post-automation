australia just banned social media for kids under 16.

if you're a PM building consumer products, this is your 18-month warning.

the uk is watching. the eu is drafting. the us is debating.

this isn't an australian problem. it's a global product problem.

and most PMs are sleepwalking into it.

here's a framework to audit your product before regulators do it for you:

THE UNDER-16 READINESS FRAMEWORK

1. exposure audit
→ what % of your users are under 16?
→ what % of your revenue depends on them?
→ if you don't know, that's your first problem

2. verification gap analysis
→ how do you currently verify age?
→ "date of birth dropdown" isn't verification. it's theatre.
→ what would real verification cost you in UX friction?

3. value without virality
→ can your product deliver value without addictive loops?
→ infinite scroll, streaks, notifications - all on the chopping block
→ what's left when you remove the dopamine mechanics?

4. parent-first pivot
→ could parents become your user instead of the gatekeeper?
→ products that align parent and child interests will win
→ products that pit them against each other will lose

5. regulatory runway
→ 18 months to comply in australia
→ assume 24-36 months for US/EU
→ that's 2-3 product cycles. not "later." now.

the PMs who act now will shape the regulations.

the PMs who wait will be shaped by them.

which one are you?
