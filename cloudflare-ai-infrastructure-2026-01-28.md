pov: you're a PM still obsessing over which AI model to use.

meanwhile, Cloudflare just gained $3 billion in market cap.

not from launching a new product.
not from beating earnings.

from an open-source AI agent going viral.

here's what nobody's talking about:

AI agents don't browse the internet like you and me.

they run 24/7.
making thousands of API calls.
fetching data.
processing requests.

every. single. second.

and all that traffic has to flow through someone's pipes.

Cloudflare's CEO said it perfectly:

"future AI agents will inherently have to pass through our network."

this is the shift product managers need to understand:

1. your next user isn't human
→ they don't sleep, don't take breaks
→ design for 1000x the API calls

2. seat-based pricing is dying
→ how do you charge "per seat" when the user runs 24/7?
→ consumption-based models win

3. the moat is moving to infrastructure
→ AI models will commoditize
→ whoever owns the traffic wins

we're in an AI gold rush.

but the winners won't be the ones mining.

they'll be the ones selling the pickaxes.

what infrastructure bets are you watching?
