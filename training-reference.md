### Example 1 (1493 reactions):
```
pov: 2025 was the year when you finally took action.

2023: i was a shy newbie creator trying to make $1
2025: serial entrepreneur & investor with 300k followers

this wasn't just luck... i followed 6 key rules (steal them)

1. if you're overthinking: take action and fail faster
2. if you want to make money: ship fast and iterate later
3. if you failed: look at the data and try again next week
4. if you feel burnt out: it's not effort, it's misalignment
5. if clients aren't buying: clarify the outcome for them
6. if you're not taken seriously: build proof so they do

short rules, effective when executed daily.

2025 was the year i realised not everything needs a framework or a step by step. just you taking the steps.

every business problem is a mindset problem.

fix your mind first, your ability to find the solution will come soon after that. promise.

please take 1 rule and write it down on paper.

stick it infront of your desk would love to see it!

ps: what was the 1 rule that helped you win in 2025
```

### Example 2 (1871 reactions):
```
I built my first business to 6-figures after class.

The reason? I didn't wait until "I felt ready" and you shouldn't either, because you already are.

You don't need a logo, your first customers won't care.
You don't need a website, your ideal client wants proof.

You don't even need a shiny degree, you just need skill.

We're taught to wait until everything is perfect.
But perfect never comes, procrastination does, though.

If you want to launch your new business.
Or promote a new offer you've been perfecting.

Do this instead:

1. List the 5 key problems you are solving for someone.
2. Ask ChatGPT to expand on why this needs solving.
3. Create content on LinkedIn using the pain + solution
4. Use social proof wherever you can (can borrow it too)
5. Post case studies of people who you've helped
6. If you haven't yet, write about how this helped you
7. Take 10 people on this offer for free to get real results
8. Create content around these repeating steps 1-5

One fool-proof way to get clients (free or paid):

1. Search for people who look like you can help on Linky.
2. Send them a loom or gamma doc with your system
3. Tell them step-by-step how you can help immediatley

Do this 20x a week, I guarantee you'll land a client.
```

### Example 3 (2290 reactions):
```
I got invited to the LinkedIn HQ in London, and what I haven't stopped thinking about what I heard...

LinkedIn is going all in on one format.

Video.

They've tried it before, but it died down in 2024.

Millions of impressions per video.
Hundreds of new followers.

Then, it stopped working. The reason?

They were testing different theories.

Understanding the best avenue for monetization.

And they found it. They called it BrandLink.

Where you get paid for the videos you post.
Not just a random boost in virality.

This will be a gold mine for professionals who want to share more videos.

But look I get it, video isn't for everyone.

So here's where you win (without video):

LinkedIn is betting on "industry experts" more than ever.

Meaning:

•⁠  ⁠Your profile must show your expertise.
•⁠  ⁠Your content must show your expertise.
•⁠  ⁠Your comments must show your expertise.

Make sure your LinkedIn reflects YOUR expertise.

Do this and you'll win in 2026.

P.S If you want a full breakdown of what this means, I recorded a 10-minute masterclass for you. Comment the word breakdown below and I'll send it to you!

## Full Lenny Post Examples:

### Example 1 (605 reactions):
```
My top takeaways from Tomer Cohen (LinkedIn CPO):

1. Don't wait for permission or perfect conditions to make change. Start using AI tools immediately, build examples of success, and demonstrate what's possible. The incentives align: organizations need people who can adapt quickly, and you need to stay relevant in your career.

2. Building products isn't complex—the process has made it complex. Product development itself is simple: research a problem, design it, code it, launch it, and iterate. But over time, companies turned each step into dozens of sub-steps requiring multiple teams, reviews, and functions.

3. According to LinkedIn's data, by 2030, 70% of the skills needed to do your current job will change. Whether or not you're planning to change jobs, your job is changing, and the only question is whether you can keep up.

4. LinkedIn replaced its Associate Product Manager program with an Associate "Product Builder" program, which teaches employees coding, design, and product management all together. Starting in January 2025, new hires learn all three disciplines from day one rather than specializing in one function. This represents a fundamental shift in how companies develop talent.

5. Feeding AI agents curated "gold examples" works far better than giving them access to everything. When LinkedIn tried letting AI tools access all their internal documents and data, it failed miserably—the AI couldn't determine what was important and produced unreliable results. The key is carefully selecting the best examples and highest-quality information. Quality matters more than quantity.

6. Top performers adopt AI tools more than struggling employees do, making great people even better. Contrary to expectations that AI would help lower performers catch up, the best talent at LinkedIn uses these tools most actively. AI appears to amplify existing capabilities rather than level the playing field, with top performers having an innate drive to stay at the cutting edge of their craft.

7. The formula for measuring AI's value is: experimentation volume × quality ÷ time to launch. This framework helps assess whether AI implementation is actually working. Success means teams can run more experiments, produce higher-quality work, and reduce the time from idea to launch—all three factors must improve together.

8. Getting AI adoption is 20% technology, 80% change management. Only about 5% of employees will naturally adopt cutting-edge tools on their own. The vast majority need active support through cultural change: updating performance reviews, celebrating wins publicly, dedicated training, and having leaders personally demonstrate tools rather than delegate. You need to give people time to invest before expecting productivity gains.
```

### Example 2 (299 reactions):
```
Three ways a spot a top 1% startup

1. Ambition bordering on "ludicrous"

Bob McGrew (early Palantir, OpenAI): "Both Palantir and OpenAI were considered ludicrous when the companies were first started."

Soleio (early Facebook, Figma, Dropbox): "I was surprised by the ferocity and ambition of the early Facebook team."

Sean Rose (early Slack, Box, Meter): "If a company's thesis is marked by extraordinary ambition, it's probably worth paying attention."

2. Judging today's product is a trap

Soleio ​said that when he first logged in to Facebook, "I remember being disappointed. The version their team had described was light-years ahead of what I saw that day."

Cristina Cordova (early Stripe, Notion, Linear) had a similar perspective: "Many of the companies I've joined were developer products or products that were meant for teams, so I couldn't truly try the product myself, as I'm not a developer or didn't have a team use case for it. So in general, I discount my own thoughts about a product in those cases."

3. Founders, over everything

Cristina Cordova: "The founders (and early team)—nothing matters more than this to me. I'm going to work hard, and I want to win, but I want to do it with people whom I want to see win too."

Sean Rose: "Quality (and authenticity) of founders have always been the most important variable to me."

To close, in the words of Cristina Cordova: "If the three most important things in real estate are location, location, location, the three most important things in startups are people, people, people."
```

### Example 3 (425 reactions):
```
LinkedIn just scrapped its APM program and replaced it with a radical new approach to product development that fully embraces what AI makes possible. It's called the "Full-Stack Builder" program.

The FSB program teaches employees how to build, design, and ship products from idea to production, with the help of their custom-built AI.

They even introduced a "Full Stack Builder" title for employees who take this path, with a full career ladder, and I strongly believe this will be a model for how established companies transform themselves to be AI-native.

In my chat with Tomer Cohen, CPO, we discuss:
- Why the traditional product development model is broken: organizational bloat slows features to a six-month cycle
- The Full Stack Builder model
- Three pillars of making FSB work: platform, agents, and culture (culture matters most)
- What it takes to build these specialized agents
- Why off-the-shelf AI tools never work on enterprise code without customization
- Why top performers adopt AI tools fastest
- Change management tactics: celebrating wins, making tools exclusive, updating performance reviews

# SECTION 3: STEVEN BARTLETT - SOOTHING WRITING STYLE

**Why study Steven**: His writing is warm, reflective, and emotionally honest. He connects through vulnerability and thoughtfulness.

## Style Patterns:

### Pattern 1: Personal Reflection Opening
```
my health is foundation number one, my dog, my girlfriend, my businesses, my money - all of it sits on top of this table called my health.

If you remove my health, I lose everything.
```

### Pattern 2: Contrarian/Unpopular Opinion
```
this is probably an unexpected opinion coming from me... entrepreneurship is over-sold and self-awareness is under-sold

The not so popular truth is, most people would be happier with a good salary than a successful startup.
```

### Pattern 3: Wisdom From Experience
```
A message to 16 year old me.... one of the biggest unlocks early in your career will be "proximity"...

....not the proximity everyone talks about. Not "get in the room where it happens"
```

### Pattern 4: Emotional Honesty
```
pov: you become the first millionaire in your family

i never thought I'd get to write this post.

not long ago i was yet another unemployed student.

struggled with anxiety and depression.
couldn't land an interview at "my dream" company.
```

## Full Steven Post Examples:

### Example 1 (10,962 reactions):
```
this is probably an unexpected opinion coming from me... entrepreneurship is over-sold and self-awareness is under-sold

The not so popular truth is, most people would be happier with a good salary than a successful startup.

But social media continues to push a generation to optimise for lives they don't actually want.

Entrepreneurs like me get a lot of likes and followers when we tell people to quit their jobs and chase their dreams.

But here is the context that we nearly always miss

Entrepreneurship can be really really boring - you will have to do things you do not enjoy.

You will deal with big, hard, stressful problems, every day - including bank holidays, christmas and any other time off - for years.

If you're lucky enough to be successful, the problems will get bigger, not smaller.

You will not have one boss. You will have hundreds - every customer, every investor, every employee. You will answer to them 24/7.

You will probably work 3x the hours you do now, have 10x the stress and a tiny probability of significant success.

A recent survey found 87.7% of founders deal with at least mental health issues. That's not a bug. It's a feature of entrepreneurship.

You'll see your kids less. You'll probably earn less (for years, maybe forever).

You will probably pay yourself last and as little as possible.

You'll struggle to switch off. Forever. Your phone will probably become a prison.

And here's the punchline: If you succeed, it all gets harder.

More money = more complexity. More growth = more anxiety. More success = more people depending on you.

In life, when you find yourself following someone else's playbook, you are at risk of winning someone else's prizes. All I'm saying is be intentional.

I'm not AGAINST entrepreneurship, I'm FOR self-awareness.

Truth "wealth" is probably

Knowing what game you want to play and why
Having the courage not to play other people's games
Understanding your real strengths and weaknesses
Designing within them, not against them

Happiness is not about the structure, the social media post or the story.

Happiness is about alignment. Building a life that's aligned to whoever you are!

pov: you become the first millionaire in your family

i never thought I'd get to write this post.

not long ago i was yet another unemployed student.

struggled with anxiety and depression.
couldn't land an interview at "my dream" company.

i'd given up on myself, my dreams and future.

but my dad never did. not once.

where i saw struggle, he saw opportunity.

see, my dad grew up poor. picking cotton from the fields in mexico. he worked day and night to get out of it.

just to be able to give me a life worth living.

and every day i make sure i do.

because if i can't do it for me, i'm doing it for him.

can't complain about my plate being full when the goal was to eat.

grateful to everyone who's given me a platform to grow.
and proud of whoever is on the same journey.

keep going, i believe in you.

Dear, first business owners... 95% of your problems are old problems wearing new clothes... please understand this framework

That supplier who's ghosting you? Caesar had the same issue with grain merchants 100s of years ago.

That investor who keeps moving the goalposts? The Medici banks dealt with that in 1400s Florence.

Your co-founder drama? Jobs and Wozniak. Gates and Allen. Every founding story ever...

Do not convince yourself your situation is special.

Or that your market is different.

Or that your generation is unique.

Stop trying to solve everything from first principles, you're not the first human to run a business...

Someone probably solved the problem that is keeping you up at night in 1987. And 1993. And 2004. And last Tuesday.

I've been in business for about 15 years and it's taken me 12 of them to realise that the first question to ask yourself when you're facing a challenge is...

"Has anyone solved this before?"

OLD PROBLEMS = FIND EXPERTISE
NEW PROBLEMS = FAST EXPERIMENTATION

The tragedy I see all the time is founders wasting their prime years solving solved problems...

They're brainstorming HR policies that P&G nailed in the 80s.

Their revolutionary approach to email marketing? Someone A/B tested that in 2015.

That radical pricing strategy? It's chapter 4 in a book from 1992.

The smartest founders I know are intellectual thieves - they steal everything that's been solved and pour all their creativity into the 5% that's genuinely unprecedented...
```

### Example 4 (2,628 reactions):
```
Science shows us that CEO's and Managers HAVE TO celebrate the small wins if they want to motivate their team... I call this the 'Progress Principle'

'The Progress Principle' is one of the biggest drivers of motivation, joy, and fulfilment in our work.

Not money.
Not recognition.
Not titles.
Progress.

Harvard researchers Teresa Amabile and Steven Kramer studied 12,000 diary entries from over 200 employees and discovered something fascinating: on days when people felt they made even a small amount of progress toward meaningful goals:

Their motivation soared.
Their mood improved.
Their creativity spiked.
They performed better.

It didn't matter how big the win was. It could've been ticking off a to-do list item, making headway on a tricky project, or even getting clarity on a decision.

Progress, however small, created momentum.

And momentum created belief!

The best CEO's, Founders and Managers understand this, and they actively celebrate and point out progress often, even if it's tiny!

Consequently, their teams are the most fired up, the most engaged and the most productive.

And the best part is... doing this is FREE

# SECTION 4: RAY THANNI - YOUR OWN VOICE (TOP POSTS)

**Study your own successful patterns to stay authentic.**

### Your Top Post (15 reactions):
```
I'm watching product managers make a $100,000 mistake.

They're still asking: "Should I go all-in on Apple? Microsoft? Google?"

Wrong question.

Here's what nobody's saying out loud:

Today's eco-system will be irrelevant in 18 months.

AI broke the game.

And most PMs are too busy optimizing their Notion setup to notice.

Here's what's actually happening:

Every productivity app you use is becoming a thin wrapper around the same AI models.

Apple's tools. Microsoft's suite. Google's workspace. Notion's everything.

They're all racing to integrate the same foundation models.

Which means the "ecosystem advantage" is dying.

The brutal truth for product managers:

If you're still building products that lock users into YOUR ecosystem, you're building a time bomb.

Users don't want your walled garden anymore.

They want AI that works EVERYWHERE.

Here's the playbook I'm leveraging (and you should too):

1. Audit your product roadmap through the "AI-agnostic lens"
→ For every feature, ask: "Does this work if the user switches platforms tomorrow?"
→ If the answer is no, you're building technical debt

2. Design for the "AI layer," not the app layer
→ Stop thinking "What's our Slack integration strategy?"
→ Start thinking "How does our product export/import via API for any AI agent?"

3. Build your moat around DATA, not interfaces
→ Notion realized this early: their lock-in isn't the UI, it's your structured knowledge
→ Your competitive advantage is the intelligence you build FROM user data, not the pretty dashboard

4. Treat interoperability as a FEATURE, not a threat
→ The PM instinct is to trap users with friction
→ The win? Make it stupidly easy to move data in AND out

5. Shift your metrics from "engagement" to "workflow completion"
Old metric: Daily Active Users
New metric: Problems Solved Per Session

Product Managers: Elon Musk's approach to the X platform's transparency is changing the game—here's a builders framework behind it.

This infographic caught my attention—it shows the complexity of launching transparency features at scale.

Transparency & trust features are the highest-risk product launches you'll ever manage.

Here are 4 design principles I look for when building transparency at scale:

PRINCIPLE #1: Universal enforcement architecture
Can leadership toggle your feature on/off for specific users? Consistent application is essential.

PRINCIPLE #2: Accuracy-first mandate
Can you verify 99.9%+ accuracy on high-visibility accounts before launch? Transparency features require exceptional data quality from day one.

PRINCIPLE #3: Built-in context layer
Data without context creates confusion.
Location data needs to explain VPNs, diaspora communities, remote work, and global teams. Context turns data into understanding rather than speculation.

PRINCIPLE #4: Explicit trade-off articulation
Every transparency feature is a trade-off between disclosure and privacy.
Complete this: "This feature helps [who] by exposing [what] about [who], and the benefit is [specific value we're creating]."

Trust features require different thinking than growth features. You can't A/B test your way to credibility.

### Your Third Best Post:
```
While Nvidia & OpenAI play valuation checkers, Google plays chess:
re-shaping the future for product teams and multimodal AI advancements

Here's what happened while Product Managers were debating ChatGPT vs Claude:

Google didn't try to build the "best" AI.
They just built AI where 3 billion people already work.

Think about your last week:
How many docs did you write in Google Docs?
How many emails in Gmail?
How many visits to Google Drive? Youtube?
How many meetings in Google Meet?
How many Googlesheets for that quick analysis?

You didn't "adopt" Google Workspace.
You've been living in it for years!

This is why Gemini is eating everyone's lunch:
OpenAI has the best model (until 2 days ago). But zero distribution.
Microsoft has enterprise contracts. But Copilot is a $30/month add-on nobody asked their finance team to approve.

& Google?
They just turned on AI inside the tools you already pay for.

The lesson for product managers:
Distribution beats innovation. Every. Single. Time.

You can build the smartest AI in the world.
But if I have to leave my workflow to use it?
I won't.

Google understood what Microsoft and OpenAI missed:
The best AI isn't the one with a V12 engine; It's the one that's convenient.
It's the one they don't have to think about.
