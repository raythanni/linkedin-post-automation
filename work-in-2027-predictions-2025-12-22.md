hot take: work in 2027 will be better than work in 2024.

not worse. better.

i know that's not what the headlines say.

but here's what i'm actually seeing:

1. the 4-day work week is coming faster than you think

companies aren't doing this to be nice.
they're doing it because AI makes it possible.
same output, less time, happier humans.
the early adopters are already proving it works.

2. your AI colleague will handle the stuff you hate

expense reports. meeting summaries. first drafts.
the soul-crushing admin work that eats 40% of your week?
gone.
you'll spend more time on work that actually matters.

3. remote work won the war

the RTO mandates are failing.
the data is clear: hybrid and remote workers are more productive.
by 2027, "where you work" will be a non-conversation.

4. junior roles won't disappear - they'll transform

hot take within a hot take:
AI won't kill entry-level jobs.
it'll make them more interesting.
less "fetch me data" and more "interpret this with me."

5. managers will finally have time to manage

when AI handles the spreadsheets and status updates,
managers can do what they're supposed to do:
develop people. remove blockers. think strategically.

the doom-and-gloom narrative sells clicks.

but the builders i talk to?
they're excited.

because for the first time in decades, technology might actually give us our time back.

not take it away.

what's one thing about work you hope changes by 2027?
