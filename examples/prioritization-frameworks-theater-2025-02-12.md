pov: you're a PM watching your team score features with RICE for the 47th time

and you already know what's going to win.

everyone does.

the spreadsheet is theater.

here's the uncomfortable truth about prioritization frameworks:

RICE. MoSCoW. ICE. weighted scoring. value vs effort matrices.

they don't help you prioritize.

they help you justify decisions you already made.

i've sat in hundreds of prioritization meetings.

and here's what actually happens:

1. someone builds the scoring model
2. leadership already has a pet feature in mind
3. the weights get "adjusted" until that feature wins
4. everyone pretends the math decided

we're not prioritizing.

we're doing prioritization theater.

here's what nobody tells new PMs:

the best product decisions i've seen came from:

- a founder who just knew (and was right)
- a PM who talked to 5 customers that week
- someone who shipped fast, watched the data, and killed it faster

not from a spreadsheet where "impact" is scored 1-5 by people guessing.

frameworks aren't useless.

but they're a crutch.

they give teams permission to avoid the hard conversations:

"we're doing this because the CEO wants it."
"we're doing this because we don't actually know, so we're running an experiment."
"we're NOT doing this because it doesn't align with our strategy."

that's it.

that's the real prioritization framework.

honesty > formulas.

the best PMs i know don't hide behind spreadsheets.

they make the call, own it, and move.

what's the most useless prioritization ritual you've seen?
