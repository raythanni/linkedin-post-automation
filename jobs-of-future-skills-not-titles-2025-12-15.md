pov: you're a product manager updating your resume in 2025

and you just realized your job title is becoming... irrelevant.

here's what nobody's telling you:

PM. BA. UX Designer. These aren't three jobs anymore.

They're becoming one.

LinkedIn just killed their Associate Product Manager program.
Replaced it with "Full-Stack Builders" — people who design, code, AND ship.

This isn't a trend. It's the new baseline.

The data backs it up (World Economic Forum, 2025-2030):

→ Big Data Specialists: +110% growth
→ AI/ML Specialists: +80% growth
→ Software Developers: +65% growth
→ UI/UX Designers: +55% growth

notice what's NOT on the list?

"Product Manager."
"Business Analyst."
"Project Coordinator."

not because these jobs disappear.

but because they're merging into something new.

AI didn't kill these roles. It fused them.

when AI can write your PRD, generate your wireframes, and analyze your user data in seconds...

...the value isn't in doing those tasks.

it's in knowing WHEN to do them. And WHY.

the new career playbook:

1. stop chasing job titles
→ "Senior PM" means nothing if you can't ship

2. start stacking skills
→ learn enough design to prototype
→ learn enough code to build MVPs
→ learn enough data to validate assumptions

3. your moat is judgment, not tasks
→ AI handles execution
→ you handle decisions

the job market isn't rewarding specialists anymore.

it's rewarding builders who can think end-to-end.

chase skills. not titles.

what skill are you stacking next?
