pov: your company just approved a $2M "AI transformation" budget

and you already know it's going to fail.

here's the uncomfortable truth nobody wants to say out loud:

AI didn't change what makes digital transformation work.

It just made failure faster and more expensive.

I've watched 3 transformation projects crash this year alone.

Same pattern every time:
- Executives get excited about AI
- They buy tools before defining problems
- Teams get confused, resist, or just ignore it
- 12 months later: "transformation fatigue" and a write-off

The companies winning at AI transformation?

They're boring. Obsessively focused on people first.

Here's the framework I keep coming back to:

1. Problem before platform
→ What specific workflow is broken?
→ Can you explain the pain in one sentence?
→ If not, you're not ready to buy anything

2. Champions before rollout
→ Find 3-5 believers who'll test and iterate
→ Let them build proof before you mandate adoption
→ Internal advocates beat external consultants every time

3. Measure behavior, not software
→ Stop tracking "licenses deployed"
→ Start tracking "time saved per task" or "decisions made faster"
→ If people aren't changing how they work, the tool is furniture

4. Small wins before big bets
→ One team. One workflow. One month.
→ Prove value. Then expand.
→ The $2M budget should be the last step, not the first

AI is an accelerant.

Pour it on a broken process? Faster mess.
Pour it on a clear workflow with bought-in people? Compounding gains.

The technology has never been the hard part.

Getting humans to change how they work? That's the transformation.

what's the biggest transformation mistake you've seen?
