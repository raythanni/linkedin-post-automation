pov: you're a product manager googling "will AI replace PMs" at 2am

let me save you some sleep.

i've been watching the AI-in-product discourse for 2 years now.

here's what's actually changing vs. the hype:

THE HYPE:
"AI will write your PRDs"
"AI will do your user research"
"AI will make product decisions"

THE REALITY:
AI is making the tactical work faster.
but it's making the strategic work harder.

here's what i mean:

yes, AI can draft a PRD in 30 seconds.
but now everyone expects you to ship 10x faster.

yes, AI can summarize user interviews.
but now you need to spot what the AI missed.

yes, AI can generate 50 feature ideas.
but now prioritization is the only skill that matters.

the job isn't shrinking. it's shapeshifting.

linkedin gets this.

they scrapped their entire APM program and replaced it with "full-stack builders" - people who can design, code, AND do product.

not because PMs are obsolete.

because the lines between roles are dissolving.

the PMs who thrive in 2025:

1. use AI for speed, not for thinking
2. double down on customer intuition (AI can't feel frustration)
3. get dangerous in adjacent skills (design, data, even basic code)
4. focus on problems worth solving, not features worth shipping

the PMs who struggle:

1. outsource judgment to AI tools
2. hide behind process and frameworks
3. think "prompt engineering" is a personality

AI isn't replacing product managers.

it's exposing the ones who were just project managers all along.

which one are you becoming?
