as kids we were told "safety first."

what happened?

openai just disbanded their alignment team. the one group responsible for making sure AI doesn't go off the rails.

this isn't an openai post. this is a leadership post.

because i've seen this movie before.

at a previous company, leadership loved talking about values. "quality first." "customer obsession." "we don't cut corners."

then the pressure hit.

first, they quietly moved the "values people" to different teams. then they stopped hiring for those roles. then the roles disappeared entirely.

the PR stayed the same. the reality didn't.

six months later? a crisis that "nobody saw coming."

everyone saw it coming.

here's what i learned: **the warning signs are always there before the collapse.**

if you're a leader (or work for one), ask yourself these questions:

1. **who in your org is paid to say "slow down"?**
do they still have power? or have they been "restructured" into irrelevance?

2. **when's the last time leadership celebrated a "no"?**
not a yes that made money. a no that protected the company.

3. **what happens when speed and values conflict?**
look at the last 3 decisions. which one won?

4. **are the "values people" in the room - or cc'd after?**
there's a difference between consultation and notification.

5. **would you bet your career on your company's stated values?**
not the posters. the actual behaviour.

openai isn't unique. they're just loud about it.

most companies do this quietly. that's worse.

watch what they do, not what they say.

what's one warning sign you've seen that others missed?
